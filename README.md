# n-times-test
Sample project to demonstrate different ways to run the same test N times.

## Installation

Run `npm install` to install the dev dependencies.

## Running the sample tests

Run `npm t` to run the tests in headless mode.

After running them, you should see a result like this.

```sh
Running:  sample.spec.js                                                                  (1 of 1)
